# XmasMM Development Steps

> **📋 For AI Agents**: This document has been restructured for optimal AI consumption. Each task is now in a separate file in the `tasks/` folder for focused implementation.

## Quick Navigation
- **🎯 Current Priority**: [Task 5A - Dynamic Canvas Sizing](tasks/Task_5A_DynamicCanvas.md)
- **📊 Process Overview**: [README_DevProcess.md](README_DevProcess.md)
- **📁 All Tasks**: [tasks/](tasks/) folder
- **⚡ Quick Reference**: [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](QUICK_REFERENCE.md)

## Task Status Overview

### ✅ Completed Foundation (Tasks 1-5.2)
| Task | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | ✅ | Project structure & GitHub Pages |
| 2 | ✅ | Main menu with Christmas theme |
| 3 | ✅ | Difficulty selection & core game logic |
| 4 | ✅ | Inline guessing UX with modal picker |
| 5.1 | ✅ | Mobile-friendly element selection |
| 5.2 | ✅ | Christmas element images |

### 🎯 Mobile Foundation Priority (Tasks 5A-5C)
| Task | File | Status | Critical For |
|------|------|--------|--------------|
| 5A | [Dynamic Canvas](tasks/Task_5A_DynamicCanvas.md) | 🎯 **CURRENT** | iPhone compatibility |
| 5B | [Family UX](tasks/Task_5B_FamilyUX.md) | 📋 Queued | User guidance |
| 5C | [Mobile Layout](tasks/Task_5C_MobileLayout.md) | 📋 Queued | Bug fixes |

### 📋 Feature Completion (Tasks 6-10)
| Task | File | Status | Focus |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 6 | [Christmas Theme](tasks/Task_6_ChristmasTheme.md) | 📋 Queued | Visual feedback |
| 7 | [Round Over](tasks/Task_7_RoundOver.md) | 📋 Queued | Game completion |
| 8 | [Audio](tasks/Task_8_Audio.md) | 📋 Queued | Christmas sounds |
| 9 | [Quality Indicators](tasks/Task_9_QualityIndicators.md) | 📋 Queued | Learning support |
| 10 | [Testing & Deploy](tasks/Task_10_Testing.md) | 📋 Queued | Family testing |

## Expert Mobile Architecture
The task sequence is optimized for:
- **Mobile-First**: iPhone SE to Pro Max compatibility
- **Family-Friendly**: Intuitive for all ages
- **Maintainable**: Clear structure for Java developer
- **AI-Optimized**: Single-focus task files

## For AI Agents

### ✅ Completed Work Context
All foundation work is complete through Task 5.2. The game has:
- Working Phaser.js structure with modular code
- Main menu, difficulty selection, and core game logic
- Touch-based modal element picker with Christmas images
- Santa's Hint feature and scoring system
- Mobile-optimized UI with inline guessing

### 🎯 Next Actions
1. **Start with**: [Task_5A_DynamicCanvas.md](tasks/Task_5A_DynamicCanvas.md)
2. **Focus**: Make canvas responsive for all iPhone models
3. **Priority**: Mobile foundation before feature additions

### 📁 File Organization Benefits
- **Focused Work**: Each task file contains only relevant information
- **No Duplicates**: Single source of truth per task
- **Clear Dependencies**: Tasks reference prerequisites  
- **Mobile Context**: Each task considers iPhone optimization
- **Family Focus**: All tasks maintain family-friendly design principles

## Legacy Document
The original comprehensive document is preserved in git history for reference.

**Architecture**: This restructure eliminates duplicates and optimizes for AI agent consumption while maintaining all technical requirements and family-focused design principles.
