# üõ†Ô∏è **Latest Fixes Applied** (Round 2)

## ‚úÖ **Issue #1 Fixed**: Removed Obsolete ElementPicker.js
- **Removed** `ElementPicker.js` file entirely (not used in unified layout)
- **Updated** `ModuleLoader.js` to remove ElementPicker references  
- **Result**: No confusion with legacy modal picker, cleaner codebase

## ‚úÖ **Issue #2 Fixed**: Reduced Gap Between Last Guess and Active Row
- **Reduced** spacing in `calculateInlineActiveRowPosition()` from +30 to +10px
- **Reduced** element bar gap from -50 to -35px above active row
- **Synchronized** `scrollToActiveRow()` calculation to match ActiveRowManager
- **Improved** scroll calculation to account for element bar + active row height
- **Result**: Much tighter spacing, active row stays visible on screen

## üìã **Files Modified in Round 2**

### `ActiveRowManager.js`:
- Reduced spacing calculations for tighter layout
- Element bar positioned closer to active row

### `HistoryScroller.js`:  
- Synchronized active row position calculation with ActiveRowManager
- Improved scroll-to-active logic to keep element bar + active row visible
- Reduced aggressive scrolling margins

### `ModuleLoader.js`:
- Removed ElementPicker.js references from both loading groups

### **Removed Files**:
- ‚ùå `js/managers/ElementPicker.js` - No longer needed

## üß™ **Test Focus Areas (Round 2)**

Please test specifically:

1. **Spacing**: Check if gap between last guess (row 8) and active row is much smaller
2. **Visibility**: Element bar and active row should stay visible even with 8+ guesses
3. **No Errors**: Confirm ElementPicker removal doesn't cause any console errors
4. **Scroll Behavior**: When you have 8+ guesses, active row should auto-scroll to stay visible but not go off-screen

The spacing should now be much more compact and usable! üéØ
