# üéØ RoundOver Scene Polish & History UX

## üé™ Overview
The RoundOver scene needs final polish and the "View History" feature within the RoundOver scene needs mobile optimization. This is different from the main GameScene history which is already completed.

## üì± Current Issues

### **RoundOver Main Screen Polish**
- **Layout Refinement**: Some spacing and positioning could be improved
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Better emphasis on key information
- **Button Flow**: Optimize button placement and visual priority
- **Mobile Touch Targets**: Ensure all interactions are thumb-friendly

### **RoundOver History View** (Accessed via "View History" button)
- **Row Height**: Currently 60px - may be too tall for mobile
- **Content Density**: Could show more history rows without scrolling
- **Touch Targets**: Ensure history rows are appropriately sized
- **Visual Clarity**: Row backgrounds and feedback symbols could be optimized
- **Navigation**: Back button and overall flow could be improved
- **Solution Display**: Add clear solution display for educational review (from UI-004)

## üõ†Ô∏è Files to Focus On

### **Primary File**
- `js/scenes/RoundOver.js` - Lines 280-450 (createHistoryView, createHistoryRow methods)

### **Key Methods**
- `createHistoryView()` - History screen layout and solution display
- `createHistoryRow()` - Individual history row rendering
