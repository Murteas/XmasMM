**Parent Task**: UsabilityImprovements  

## Objective
Enhance the RoundOver scene with better victory celebrations and improved loss state displays to create more engaging and educational end-game experiences.

## Background
Currently the RoundOver scene provides basic score breakdown but lacks engaging celebration for wins and could better display the solution for learning purposes when players lose.

## Specific Enhancements Needed

### 1. Victory Celebration Improvements
**Current State**: Simple "Success!" text with score breakdown
**Target**: Engaging Christmas-themed celebration that feels rewarding

**Enhancements:**
- 🎄 **Animated Christmas Elements**: Falling snowflakes, twinkling stars
- 🏆 **Victory Message Enhancement**: Larger, more prominent success messaging
- ⭐ **Achievement Indicators**: Show specific accomplishments (speed, hints used, etc.)
- 🎊 **Christmas Confetti**: Burst of Christmas element images on win
- 📈 **Score Animation**: Animated counter showing score building up
- 🔔 **Audio Integration**: Celebratory sound effects (when audio system ready)

### 2. Loss State Enhancement  
**Current State**: Basic score breakdown, no solution display
**Target**: Educational and encouraging loss experience

**Enhancements:**
- 🎯 **Visual Solution Display**: Show solution using actual game element images
- 💡 **Learning Insights**: "What you learned" section highlighting close calls
- 🔄 **Encouraging Messaging**: Positive, motivating language for next attempt
- 📊 **Progress Indicators**: Show how close they were to solving
- 🎅 **Hint Recommendations**: Suggest using Santa's hints next time

### 3. Consistent Experience Architecture
**Current State**: Game over overlays removed for consistency
**Target**: All end-game states handled through RoundOver scene

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Consistent UI Flow**: No jarring overlay interruptions
