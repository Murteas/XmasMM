# Task 11: Additional Usability Improvements

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PENDING (blocked by 10)  
**Objective**: Implement additional usability enhancements to improve family gaming experience based on testing and feedback.
> ðŸ“Š **Note**: Status managed in [tasks.json](../tasks.json). Use `python scripts/automation.py status` for current state.


## Why This Matters
After establishing core functionality, there are always opportunities to make the game more enjoyable, accessible, and family-friendly through thoughtful usability improvements.

## Potential Usability Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Visual Feedback
- Add subtle animations when elements are selected
- Improve feedback for correct/incorrect guess submissions
- Add visual indicators for game progress (e.g., guess counter with visual bar)
- Consider adding celebration effects for good guesses

### 2. Accessibility Improvements
- Add larger touch targets option for younger or older family members
- Implement high contrast mode for better visibility
- Add optional sound effects for visual feedback (pending Task 8)
- Consider adding element labels that can be toggled on/off

### 3. Quality of Life Features
- Add "Undo" functionality for the current guess before submission
- Implement automatic saving of game state (resume after interruption)
- Add option to clear current row and start over
- Consider adding a "Show Rules" button accessible during gameplay

### 4. UI Layout Adjustments
- **Guesses Counter Positioning**: Move "Guesses: X" text slightly to the left for better visual balance
  - **Current Issue**: Guesses counter may be too close to screen edge or other elements
  - **File**: `js/managers/UILayoutManager.js` - adjust positioning in `setupStackedHeader()` and `setupHorizontalHeader()`
  - **Implementation**: Reduce X position from current `50` to `30-40` pixels from left edge

### Medium Priority
- Add confirmation dialog for "Back" button during active game
- Implement gesture support for common actions (swipe to undo, etc.)
- Add customizable element picker layouts
- Consider adding difficulty-specific UI adaptations

### Low Priority
- Statistics tracking
- Additional themes
- Social sharing features

## Files That May Be Modified
- Most existing scene and manager files
- Possible new utility files for enhanced features
- CSS for accessibility options
- TestConfig.js for feature toggles

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Game feels more polished and responsive
- [ ] Family members of all ages can play comfortably
- [ ] Edge cases and error states are handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance is smooth on target devices
- [ ] Features enhance rather than complicate the core game experience

## Research and Testing Needed
- Observe family members playing to identify pain points
- Test with different age groups to understand accessibility needs
- Benchmark performance on various devices
- Gather feedback on most-wanted features

## Design Principles
- **Simplicity**: Don't add complexity for its own sake
- **Accessibility**: Make game enjoyable for all family members  
- **Performance**: Maintain smooth gameplay on all target devices
- **Polish**: Small details make big differences in user experience

## Notes
This task serves as a placeholder for improvements discovered during development and testing. Items can be moved to separate, more specific tasks as priorities become clear.

**Migration Note**: This task was renumbered from Task 14 to Task 11 to fix task numbering sequence (2025-07-10).
