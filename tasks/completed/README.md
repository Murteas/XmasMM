# Completed Tasks Archive

This directory contains tasks that have been completed and are no longer active. These files are kept for historical reference and documentation purposes.

## Archived Tasks

### Phase 1: Mobile Foundation (COMPLETED)

## Why Archive Completed Tasks?

1. **Prevent Accidental Changes**: Completed tasks should not receive new features
2. **Maintain Clean Active Task List**: Focus only on current and pending work
3. **Historical Reference**: Keep documentation for future reference
4. **Clear Project Status**: Make it obvious what work is truly complete

## Task Migration Notes

- **2025-07-10**: Created archive system to clean up completed tasks
- **2025-07-10**: Renumbered Task 14 → Task 11 to fix numbering sequence

## Accessing Archived Tasks
