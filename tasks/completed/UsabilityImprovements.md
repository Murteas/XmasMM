- Verify consistent touch target sizes and spacing
- Ensure visual elements render consistently across different browsers
- Validate performance across different hardware capabilities

### 3. Long-Term Maintainability Enhancements
- Document all component APIs and dependencies
- Create comprehensive developer setup guide
