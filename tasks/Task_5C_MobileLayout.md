# Task 5C: Fix Mobile Layout Issues

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ QUEUED  
**Objective**: Fix specific mobile layout bugs including modal picker spacing, history display positioning, and button placement conflicts.

## Current Issues to Address

### 3. Button Positioning Problems
- Santa's Hint button covered during scrolling
- Scroll buttons not working properly
- Touch targets too small or overlapping

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Fix Modal Picker in `GameScene.js`
- Adjust modal height calculation in `showElementPicker()` method
- Increase spacing between element grid and cancel button
