# Mobile Scroll Enhancement Task

**Task ID**: MobileScrollEnhancement  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Planned  
**Created**: July 14, 2025  

## Objective
Implement easy swipe-based scrolling functionality for mobile users to improve the mobile game experience.

## Background
Based on testing with the populated game screen (9 guesses), identified that mobile users need better scroll functionality:
- Current scrolling may not feel natural on mobile devices
- Need smooth up/down swiping gestures
- Should work well with the MOBILE-006 safe area fixes

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Touch-Based Scrolling**
   - Implement smooth swipe up/down gestures
   - Add momentum scrolling (continues after finger lift)
   - Ensure scrolling works in game screen with multiple rows

2. **Mobile-Optimized Behavior**
   - Responsive to light touch gestures
   - Prevent accidental horizontal scrolling
   - Maintain smooth 60fps during scroll

3. **Integration with Existing Systems**
   - Work with MOBILE-006 safe area implementation
   - Respect browser UI changes (address bar show/hide)
   - Maintain submit button accessibility during scroll

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Modify
- `js/managers/GameInputHandler.js` - Add touch scroll handling
- `js/scenes/GameScene.js` - Integrate scroll behavior
- `styles.css` - CSS scroll improvements
- `tests/test_mobile_expert.html` - Add scroll testing functionality

### Implementation Details
```javascript
// Touch scroll implementation
class TouchScrollManager {
  constructor(scene) {
    this.scene = scene;
    this.setupTouchEvents();
  }
  
  setupTouchEvents() {
    // Touch start, move, end handlers
    // Momentum calculation
    // Smooth scroll animation
  }
}
```

### CSS Enhancements
```css
/* Smooth scrolling for mobile */
.game-container {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
  overscroll-behavior: contain;
}
```

## Testing Requirements

### Automated Testing
- Add scroll test to `test_mobile_expert.html`
- Performance testing during scroll
- Cross-device compatibility testing

### Manual Testing
- Test on iPhone Safari (primary target)
- Test on Android Chrome
- Verify with browser UI show/hide
- Test with different content heights

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Smooth swipe up/down scrolling implemented
- [ ] 60fps maintained during scroll
- [ ] Works on iPhone Safari and Android Chrome
- [ ] No conflicts with MOBILE-006 safe area fixes
- [ ] Submit button remains accessible during/after scroll
- [ ] Momentum scrolling feels natural

## Priority Justification
**Medium Priority** - Enhances mobile UX but not blocking gameplay. Should be implemented after:
1. MOBILE-006 critical fixes (âœ… Complete)
2. UI-002 quality indicators (next priority)
3. Other critical mobile layout issues

## Notes
- Discovered during MOBILE-006 testing with populated game screen
- Will improve overall mobile user experience
- Should coordinate with any future mobile layout optimizations
