# Task 8: Add Christmas Audio Integration

**Status**: ðŸ”„ CURRENT  
**Objective**: Add Christmas-themed audio effects and background music that enhance family gameplay without being overwhelming.
> ðŸ“Š **Note**: Status managed in [tasks.json](../tasks.json). Use `python scripts/automation.py status` for current state.


## Why This Matters
Audio adds festive atmosphere for family gatherings, but must be optional since families may be playing in quiet environments or with sleeping children.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Source Family-Friendly Audio Files (< 1MB total)
- Gentle jingle bells sound for guess submission
- Cheerful "Ho ho ho" sound for correct solutions
- Pleasant Santa chuckle for hint usage
- Soft lo-fi Christmas background music loop

### 2. Integrate Audio with Respect for Family Environment
- Preload audio files in `MainMenu.js`
- Add sound triggers in `GameScene.js` for key game events
- Implement background music loop during gameplay (very low volume)
- Connect to existing sound toggle state from main menu
- Ensure audio never blocks or delays gameplay

### 3. Test Audio for Family Use
- Verify sounds are pleasant and not startling
- Ensure audio works properly on iOS Safari (requires user interaction)
- Confirm game remains fully playable with audio disabled
- Test volume levels are appropriate for family settings

## Files to Modify
- `js/scenes/MainMenu.js` - Audio preloading and user interaction setup
- `js/scenes/GameScene.js` - Sound event triggers
- Add audio files to `assets/` folder

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Christmas sounds enhance gameplay without being intrusive
- [ ] All audio respects main menu toggle settings
- [ ] Game functions perfectly with audio disabled
- [ ] Audio files load quickly and don't delay game start
- [ ] Sounds are family-appropriate (not too loud or jarring)

## Family Environment Considerations
- **Optional Audio**: Must work perfectly without sound
- **Gentle Sounds**: Pleasant, not startling or overwhelming
- **Low Volume**: Background music very subtle
- **iOS Compatibility**: Handle Safari audio requirements
- **Quick Loading**: Audio doesn't delay game startup
