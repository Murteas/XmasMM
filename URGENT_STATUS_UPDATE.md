**Date**: July 14, 2025
**Priority**: HIGH
**Action Required**: See HANDOFF_SIMPLIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Situation

### âœ… **Problem Solved**

- **Solution**: Simple Phaser best practices architecture works perfectly

### âœ… **Proof of Concept Complete**

- **Features**: All functionality preserved with better UX

## ðŸš€ Next Session Priority

**READ**: `HANDOFF_SIMPLIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md` for complete migration plan

### **Quick Start:**
1. Backup current system: `git checkout -b backup-complex-managers`
2. Replace `GameScene.js` with simplified version
3. Delete 6 unnecessary manager files
4. Test: Active row should be visible at bottom

### **Expected Outcome:**
- 90% less code to maintain
- Always visible active row
- Better performance
- Easier to add features
