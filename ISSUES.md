## 🚨 Open Issues

### **GAME-001: Main Game Initialization Failure** ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue ID**: GAME-001  
**Date Reported**: July 15, 2025  
**Resolved**: July 15, 2025 - Fixed race condition and UI layout issues  
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Game completely unplayable from root index.html  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Priority**: P0 - IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

## Problem Description
The main game (`index.html`) showed only a blue screen without displaying the main menu. Additional UI layout issues were discovered during testing.

## Root Cause Analysis & Resolution
**Primary Issue**: Race condition between `window.onload` in `main.js` and `ModuleLoader.initializeGame()`:
- Fixed by moving Phaser config creation inside `initializeGame()` after all modules are loaded
- Removed `window.onload` dependency in favor of ModuleLoader-controlled initialization

**Secondary Issues**: UI Layout problems caused by hardcoded dimensions:
- Learn to play screen: Title obscured by top of screen
- Final screen: Score/explanation overlap, Share button obscured
- Fixed by reverting to proper Phaser responsive scaling (`width: '100%', height: '100%'`)

## Technical Solution
1. **Module Loading**: ModuleLoader now properly calls `window.initializeGame()` after all dependencies are loaded
2. **Responsive Design**: Restored Phaser best practices for responsive scaling
3. **Code Cleanup**: Removed duplicate event handlers and unused validation code

## Lessons Learned
- Always follow Phaser best practices for responsive design
- Avoid hardcoded dimensions that interfere with mobile-first layouts
- Race conditions in module loading require careful initialization sequencing

## Problem Description
The main game (`index.html`) shows only a blue screen without displaying the main menu. The issue occurs on both mobile devices and desktop browsers. Opening developer tools on desktop "fixes" the problem temporarily, suggesting a race condition or initialization timing issue.

## Symptoms
- Root `index.html` loads but shows only blue background (#1a1a2e)
- Main menu never appears
- No way to progress on mobile devices
- Test HTML files work correctly (they load Phaser differently)
- Desktop: Opening dev tools makes game suddenly work

## Root Cause Analysis
Race condition between `window.onload` in `main.js` and `ModuleLoader.initializeGame()`:
1. `index.html` calls `ModuleLoader.initializeGame()` asynchronously  
2. `main.js` registers `window.onload` handler that creates Phaser.Game
3. `window.onload` fires before scene classes are loaded by ModuleLoader
4. Phaser.Game tries to initialize with undefined scene classes
5. Game fails silently, shows only background color

## Expected Behavior
- Game should initialize properly and show main menu
- Should work consistently across all devices and browsers
- Should not require developer tools to function

## 📋 Closed Issues

### **UI-003: Misleading Live Score During Gameplay** ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue ID**: UI-003  
**Date Reported**: July 12, 2025  
**Date Resolved**: July 12, 2025  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Status**: ✅ Closed  
**Related Task**: Scoring system consistency

## Problem Description (RESOLVED)
During gameplay, the score display showed legacy scoring (1000 - guesses*100) but at game end it switched to element-based scoring with completely different logic, creating a confusing user experience.

## Solution Implemented
Replaced misleading live score with clear progress indicator:
- Changed `Score: 700` to `Guesses: 3/10`
- Reserved actual scoring for the educational breakdown at game end
- Now focuses on strategic thinking rather than score optimization during play

## Files Modified
- `js/managers/UILayoutManager.js` - Updated display text to show guess progress
- `js/managers/ScoreManager.js` - Modified updateScoreDisplay method

### **SCORE-001: Score Calculation and Display Issues** ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue ID**: SCORE-001  
**Date Reported**: July 12, 2025  
**Date Resolved**: July 12, 2025  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: ✅ Closed  
**Related Task**: RoundOverScene, ScoreManager logic

## Problem Description (RESOLVED)
Score calculation was fundamentally broken due to legacy scoring system being used instead of proper element-based scoring.

## Root Cause Identified
`GameInputHandler.js` was calling `ScoreManager.calculateScore()` (legacy 1000-based scoring) instead of `ScoreManager.calculateFinalScore()` (proper element-based scoring with complete bonus, hint penalties, etc.)

## Solution Implemented
- Modified `GameInputHandler.transitionToRoundOver()` to call `calculateFinalScore()` instead of legacy scoring
- Added safety check in ScoreManager for winning games to ensure proper element points
- This enables proper display of element points, complete bonus, speed bonus, and hint penalties

## Files Modified
- `js/managers/GameInputHandler.js` - Fixed scoring method call
- `js/managers/ScoreManager.js` - Added safety checks for winning games

### **UI-001: Score Breakdown Not Displaying on Game Over Screen** ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue ID**: UI-001  
**Date Reported**: July 12, 2025  
**Date Resolved**: July 12, 2025  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Status**: ✅ Closed  
**Related Task**: RoundOverScene (marked COMPLETED but incomplete)

## Problem Description
The Game Over screen only shows the final score (e.g., "Score: 300 points") but does not display the detailed score breakdown that shows how the score was calculated, despite the breakdown logic being implemented in the code.

## Root Cause Found
The score breakdown logic in `RoundOver.js` had conditional checks that filtered out zero values:
```javascript
if (breakdown.elementPoints > 0) breakdownParts.push(`Elements: ${breakdown.elementPoints}`);
```
This meant if a player scored 0 element points, the breakdown would be empty or nearly empty.

## Resolution Applied
**Fixed Code Logic:**
- Always display element points (even if 0) for transparency
- Show bonuses/penalties only when non-zero to avoid clutter
- Added fallback for edge cases where all values are 0
- Added debug logging to verify data structure

**Verification:**
- ✅ Score breakdown now always shows: `Elements: X  Complete: +Y  Speed: +Z`
- ✅ Educational transparency restored for family-friendly gameplay
- ✅ RoundOverScene task requirements now fully implemented

## Files Modified
- `js/scenes/RoundOver.js` - Fixed conditional logic in `createScoreDisplay()`

### **TMS-001: Task Management System Sync Issue** ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue ID**: TMS-001 → **Archived**: See `issues/archived/session-001-july-12-2025.md`  
**Date**: July 12, 2025 | **Status**: ✅ Closed
