# Task Management System Sync Issue

**Issue ID**: TMS-001  
**Date Reported**: July 12, 2025  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Status**: Open  

## Problem Description
The task management automation system has a synchronization issue where completing a task via `python scripts/automation.py complete <task>` does not properly update the task status in real-time queries.

## Symptoms Observed
1. **Task Completion**: `automation.py complete QualityIndicators` reports success
2. **Status Query**: `automation.py status` still shows QualityIndicators as CURRENT
3. **Validation Error**: System reports "No task marked as CURRENT" 
4. **File Updates**: PROJECT_STATUS.md updates correctly but status queries are inconsistent

## Impact
- **Development Workflow**: Confusion about which task is actually current
- **Automation Reliability**: Undermines confidence in task management system
- **Progress Tracking**: Inaccurate status reporting for project dashboards

## Root Cause Analysis Needed
- [ ] Check if `tasks.json` is being updated correctly during completion
- [ ] Verify if status queries are reading from correct data source
- [ ] Investigate timing issues between file writes and reads
- [ ] Review task state transitions in automation.py logic

## Temporary Workaround
- Manually verify task status by checking `tasks.json` directly
- Use PROJECT_STATUS.md as authoritative source for current state
- Cross-reference multiple status indicators before proceeding

## Next Steps
1. **Debug Session**: Run automation.py with verbose logging
2. **Code Review**: Examine task completion and status query logic
3. **Testing**: Create unit tests for task state management
4. **Documentation**: Update troubleshooting guide for this issue

## Files Involved
- `scripts/automation.py`
- `scripts/task_manager.py` 
- `tasks.json`
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
