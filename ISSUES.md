## üö® Open Issues

### UI-023: GameScene Architecture Simplification üéØ
**Priority**: Medium (Future Enhancement)  
**Category**: Technical Architecture  
**Status**: Analysis Needed

**Problem**: GameScene may be overly complex with multiple layout systems (footer container vs inline active row, scrolling vs fixed positioning)
**Impact**: Code complexity, potential maintenance challenges, harder to debug layout issues
**Context**: Originally had scrolling with inline active row, now uses footer container with fixed positioning

**Analysis Required**:
- Evaluate current footer container vs original inline active row approach  
- Compare complexity of current vs previous architecture
- Identify opportunities for simplification without losing mobile UX benefits
- Consider unified layout approach vs current hybrid system

**Questions to Investigate**:
- Is footer container approach better than inline for mobile UX?
- Can we simplify the coordinate system management?
- Are there unused/redundant layout managers?
- Would a single layout approach be more maintainable?

**Research Phase**: Expert architecture review needed before any changes
