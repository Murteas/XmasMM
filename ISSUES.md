## 🚨 Open Issues

### TECH-002: Scene Lifecycle Listener Cleanup 🔴
**Priority**: High  
**Category**: Technical Stability  
**Status**: Open

**Problem**: Global keyboard + window event listeners (resize, error, unhandledrejection) lack explicit teardown. Risk is currently low because scenes aren't re-created repeatedly, but future replay / multi-session features could expose duplicate handlers.
**Impact**: Potential for duplicate handler accumulation in future architectures; currently minimal practical impact.
**Location**: `GameScene` (keyboard), `main.js` (window events)

**Current Mitigation (Aug 11 2025)**:
- Added idempotent guard (`_debugKeysRegistered`) around debug keyboard listener so it cannot double-bind if scene setup runs again.
- Decision: Defer full detach logic until replay / multi-session flow introduced to avoid unnecessary complexity now.

**Deferred Remediation Plan** (activate when replay/multi-session added):
- Add `shutdown` / `destroy` handlers to unregister keyboard listeners
- Centralize window listener registration & cleanup
- Lightweight ListenerRegistry utility (optional)

**Acceptance Criteria (Deferred)**:
- [ ] Keyboard listeners removed on scene shutdown (when replay added)
- [ ] Window listeners cleaned when game disposed / reinitialized
- [ ] No duplicate event firings after multiple restarts
- [ ] Documented lifecycle pattern established

### TECH-001: Centralized Layout & Constants Module ✅
**Priority**: Medium  
**Category**: Maintainability  
**Status**: Resolved (August 11, 2025)

**Problem**: Repeated magic numbers (header heights 120/140, footer 120, row height 60, spacing constants) scattered across managers (e.g., `ActiveRowManager`, `GameScene`, layout methods) increase risk of drift and complicate tuning.
**Impact**: Harder to adjust UI globally; increases inconsistency risk when polishing.

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Created `js/config/LayoutConfig.js` with comprehensive layout constants
- ✅ Centralized header heights (140/120), footer heights (160), row heights (60)  
- ✅ Added mobile-specific spacing and touch target constants
- ✅ Integrated across GameScene, ActiveRowManager, UILayoutManager, HistoryScroller

**Acceptance Criteria Completed**:
- ✅ Single source for header/footer heights, row height, spacing, delay values
- ✅ Multiple high-traffic files refactored to use constants
- ✅ No behavior change (visual diff stable)
- ✅ Layout constants documented with mobile baseline (375x667)

### TECH-003: Lightweight Logger Abstraction 🟡
**Priority**: Medium  
**Category**: Developer Experience  
**Status**: Open

**Problem**: Direct `console.log` / `console.warn` calls throughout code (debug + runtime) lack centralized control, making production noise management harder.
**Impact**: Harder to silence logs for production profiling; ad‑hoc filtering required.

**Solution Direction**:
- Introduce `Logger` wrapper (levels: debug/info/warn/error)
- Gate debug output via `TestConfig.shouldShowDebugLogs()` or URL param
- Provide no-op stubs in production mode

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Logger module created and documented
- [ ] At least 10 scattered direct logs replaced (non-critical only)
- [ ] Production mode silence verified
- [ ] Debug flag re-enables expected instrumentation

### TECH-004: ESLint + Prettier (Warn-Only Integration) 🟡
**Priority**: Medium  
**Category**: Code Quality  
**Status**: Open

**Problem**: No enforced lint/format baseline; future contributors (or AI agents) may introduce inconsistent patterns.
**Impact**: Gradual readability decline; higher review overhead.

**Solution Direction**:
- Add `devDependencies` + minimal `.eslintrc` (phaser globals, browser, ES2020)
- Prettier config for consistent spacing (defer auto-format of legacy files)
- Add npm script: `lint` (no autofix) & `format:check`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] ESLint config present with Phaser globals suppressed
- [ ] Prettier config present
- [ ] Running lint produces only warnings (no blocking errors)
- [ ] Documented in AI briefing / README contribution section

### TECH-005: Asset Loading Manifest / DRY Preload 🟡
**Priority**: Low-Medium  
**Category**: Performance / Maintainability  
**Status**: Open

**Problem**: Repetitive manual image load calls for each density; harder to add/remove assets consistently.
**Impact**: Risk of omissions or mismatched keys; verbose preload.

**Solution Direction**:
- Create manifest array: `{ baseKey: 'santa', variants: ['1x','2x','3x'] }`
- Loop-driven registration in `preload()`; fallback strategy preserved
- Optional future conditional loading (only needed density)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Manifest module created (`js/config/AssetManifest.js`)
- [ ] Preload logic uses loops rather than repeated calls
- [ ] No missing textures vs prior implementation
- [ ] File count & load time unchanged or improved

### TECH-006: Debug Key Map Documentation Consistency 🟡
**Priority**: Low  
**Category**: Documentation Hygiene  
**Status**: Open

**Problem**: Debug mode documented in README & AI briefing, but no centralized authoritative reference; risk of divergence if keys evolve.
**Impact**: Minor confusion for future maintainers / agents.

**Solution Direction**:
- Add `docs/debug-mode.md` authoritative key mapping & usage guidelines
- Link from README + AI briefing; ensure in-code comment block references file

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] New doc file created and linked
- [ ] GameScene debug handler comment references doc
- [ ] README / AI briefing updated to point to single source
- [ ] Keys verified in documentation match implementation

### UI-011: Christmas Title Theming Enhancement 🎄
**Priority**: High (Next Phase)  
**Category**: Visual Polish  
**Status**: Open

**Problem**: The "XmasMM" title in the game header displays as plain white text, lacking the festive Christmas spirit and visual appeal that the rest of the game maintains.

**Current State**: Background contrast issues resolved - text protection in place, ready for implementation

**Expected Behavior**:
- Title should have Christmas-themed visual styling
- Should maintain readability while adding festive flair  
- Should complement existing Christmas color scheme (#0d5016 forest green, #ffd700 gold)

**Design Options**:
- **Option 1**: Green-to-gold gradient text matching existing palette
- **Option 2**: Decorative elements (★ snowflakes, 🎄 trees) around title
- **Option 3**: Text shadow/outline styling with Christmas colors
- **Option 4**: Gentle sparkle animation or subtle glow effect

**Location**: `js/scenes/GameScene.js` (header/title creation section)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Title has festive Christmas-themed styling
- [ ] Maintains readability across all screen sizes  
- [ ] Complements existing Christmas color scheme
- [ ] No performance impact

### UI-014: Share Score Button Requires Double-Tap 🔴
