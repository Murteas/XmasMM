## 🚨 Current Open Issues

### **UI-005: Main Menu Uses Emoji Instead of Real Game Images**

**Issue ID**: UI-005  
**Date Created**: July 15, 2025  
**Date Completed**: July 15, 2025  
**Severity**: Medium - User experience consistency  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Real images implemented successfully  
**Related Task**: UsabilityImprovements, ChristmasTheme

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**

**Solution Implemented:**
- ✅ Replaced emoji element list with actual game images (santa_1x.png, present_1x.png, etc.)
- ✅ Added real feedback symbols using feedback_perfect_star_1x.png and feedback_close_bell_1x.png
- ✅ Created responsive visual layout with proper mobile scaling
- ✅ Positioned element images in organized grid with labels
- ✅ Ensured consistent visual branding between instructions and gameplay
- ✅ Mobile-responsive sizing using layout.fontScale for all elements

**Files Modified:**
- `js/scenes/MainMenu.js` - Complete UI implementation with real game assets

**Visual Improvements:**
- Game element showcase: Real images of all 6 Christmas elements with labels
- Feedback symbol explanation: Actual star and bell images with descriptions  
- Mobile-optimized layout: Proper scaling and spacing for all screen sizes
- Consistent experience: Instructions now match actual game visuals perfectly

**Technical Implementation:**
- Element container with 6 game images positioned horizontally
- Feedback container with star/bell images and explanatory text
- Responsive scaling using `layout.fontScale` throughout
- Proper image scaling based on assumed 64px source image dimensions
- Added to help overlay container for proper depth and animation support

## Original Problem Description
The main menu "How to Play" section used emoji characters (🎅 🎁 🌟 🎄 ❄️ 🍭) to represent game elements instead of the actual game images. This created inconsistency between the instructions and the real game experience, especially with the candy cane emoji which didn't match the actual candy cane game asset.

## Original Expected Behavior
- Display actual game images instead of emoji in the element list
- Show small versions of the real santa_1x.png, present_1x.png, etc. assets
- Maintain consistent visual branding between instructions and game
- Help players recognize the actual elements they'll see in game

### **UI-004: History Screen Missing Solution Display**

**Issue ID**: UI-004  
**Date Created**: July 15, 2025  
**Severity**: Medium - Usability improvement  
**Status**: 🔧 Open  
**Related Task**: UsabilityImprovements

## Problem Description
The game history/guess review screen does not display the correct solution for post-game comparison. Players cannot easily compare their guesses against the actual solution when reviewing their game performance.

## Current Behavior
- RoundOver scene shows the solution briefly before transitioning
- History display (if accessible) shows only player guesses and feedback
- No persistent solution reference for learning and improvement

## Expected Behavior
- Solution displayed prominently at top or bottom of history screen
- Clear visual distinction from player guesses
- Accessible for educational review and pattern learning

## Proposed Implementation
- Add solution display to history renderer
- Position at top of history with clear labeling ("Solution:" or "The Answer Was:")
- Use same visual styling as game elements for consistency
- Ensure mobile-responsive positioning

## Files to Modify
- `js/managers/HistoryRenderer.js` - Add solution display method
- Potentially `js/scenes/GameScene.js` - If history view is accessible during game

## Success Criteria
- Solution clearly visible in history view
- Visually distinct from player guesses
- Mobile-responsive positioning
- Consistent with existing UI styling

   - ✅ Updated element array in `js/utils/GameUtils.js` ('Mistletoe' → 'Candy Cane')
   - ✅ Updated asset loading in `js/scenes/GameScene.js` (all resolutions: 1x, 2x, 3x)
   - ✅ Updated asset mapping in `js/scenes/RoundOver.js` 
   - ✅ Updated description text in `js/scenes/MainMenu.js` (🪴 Mistletoe → 🍭 Candy Canes)
   - ✅ All syntax validation passed
   - ✅ Game testing successful - all tests pass
2. **🗑️ Unused File Removal** ✅ **COMPLETED** (July 15, 2025) 
   - ✅ Removed 4 mistletoe assets (286KB total): `mistletoe.png`, `mistletoe_1x.png`, `mistletoe_2x.png`, `mistletoe_3x.png`
   - ✅ Removed unused background: `bg_mobile_orig.png` (119KB)
   - ✅ Fixed asset loading case sensitivity issues in `GameScene.js`
   - ✅ Total space saved: ~405KB
3. **✅ Asset Audit Complete** ✅ **COMPLETED** (July 15, 2025)
   - ✅ Final asset inventory: 34 PNG files, 6.0M total size
   - ✅ All assets verified as in use (no unused files remaining)
   - ✅ Asset loading paths corrected for case sensitivity
   - ✅ Largest assets identified for potential future optimization:
     - `feedback_perfect_star.png` (1.1M) - Christmas feedback symbol
     - `feedback_close_bell.png` (736K) - Christmas feedback symbol  
     - `snowflake.png` (731K) - Game element
     - `santa.png` (642K) - Game element
     - `candycane.png` (601K) - Game element (new!)
4. **Size Optimization**: Large feedback/element images could be compressed (optional)
5. **Resolution Analysis**: 1x/2x/3x images are appropriately sized ✅
6. **Loading Strategy**: Asset loading working efficiently ✅

## ✅ **ASSET-001 COMPLETION SUMMARY**
