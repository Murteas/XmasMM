## 🚨 Open Issues

### UI-010: Current Score Display in Game Header 🔴
**Priority**: Medium  
**Category**: UX Enhancement  
**Status**: Open

**Problem**: Game header shows "Guesses: 1/10" instead of current score, missing valuable real-time feedback
**Impact**: Players don't see scoring progress during gameplay, reducing engagement
**Location**: `js/scenes/GameScene.js` - header display area
**Solution**: Replace guess counter with live score display that updates after each guess

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Header displays "Score: XXX" instead of guess count  
- [ ] Score updates in real-time after each guess submission
- [ ] Maintains mobile readability and responsive design
- [ ] Consistent formatting with RoundOver scene

**Category**: Visual Polish  
**Status**: Open

**Problem**: "XmasMM" title appears as plain white text, lacks festive Christmas theming
**Impact**: Misses opportunity for brand personality and Christmas atmosphere  
**Location**: Game header across scenes
**Solution**: Add Christmas-themed styling (colors, effects, or decorative elements)

**Design Options**:
- Green-to-gold gradient text matching Christmas colors (#0d5016, #ffd700)
- Decorative Christmas elements (🎄 ❄️ ★)
- Text effects (shadow, outline, subtle glow)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Title has festive Christmas-themed styling
- [ ] Maintains readability across all screen sizes  
- [ ] Complements existing Christmas color scheme
- [ ] No performance impact
