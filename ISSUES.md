## 🚨 Current Open Issues

### **UI-005: Main Menu Uses Emoji Instead of Real Game Images**

**Issue ID**: UI-005  
**Date Created**: July 15, 2025  
**Severity**: Medium - User experience consistency  
**Status**: 🔧 Open  
**Related Task**: UsabilityImprovements, ChristmasTheme

## Problem Description
The main menu "How to Play" section uses emoji characters (🎅 🎁 🌟 🎄 ❄️ 🍭) to represent game elements instead of the actual game images. This creates inconsistency between the instructions and the real game experience, especially with the candy cane emoji which doesn't match the actual candy cane game asset.

## Current Behavior
- Main menu shows: "🎅 Santa, 🎁 Presents, 🌟 Stars, 🎄 Trees, ❄️ Snowflakes, 🍭 Candy Canes"
- Uses generic emoji that don't match the game's Christmas-themed assets
- Candy cane emoji (🍭) looks different from actual candy cane game image
- Creates disconnect between instructions and actual gameplay

## Expected Behavior
- Display actual game images instead of emoji in the element list
- Show small versions of the real santa_1x.png, present_1x.png, etc. assets
- Maintain consistent visual branding between instructions and game
- Help players recognize the actual elements they'll see in game

## Proposed Implementation
- Replace emoji text with actual Phaser image objects in `MainMenu.js`
- Use small scale versions of the 1x game assets (santa_1x.png, present_1x.png, etc.)
- Position images inline with text or create a visual element grid
- Ensure mobile-responsive sizing and layout
- Consider similar treatment for feedback symbols (replace ★ 🔔 with actual feedback images)

## Files to Modify
- `js/scenes/MainMenu.js` - Replace emoji text with actual game images
- Potentially update layout logic for image positioning

## Success Criteria
- Real game images displayed in "How to Play" section
- Images properly scaled and positioned for mobile
- Consistent visual experience between instructions and game
- All 6 elements (Santa, Present, Candy Cane, Star, Tree, Snowflake) use actual assets
- Maintain readable text layout

### **UI-004: History Screen Missing Solution Display**

**Issue ID**: UI-004  
**Date Created**: July 15, 2025  
**Severity**: Medium - Usability improvement  
**Status**: 🔧 Open  
**Related Task**: UsabilityImprovements

## Problem Description
The game history/guess review screen does not display the correct solution for post-game comparison. Players cannot easily compare their guesses against the actual solution when reviewing their game performance.

## Current Behavior
- RoundOver scene shows the solution briefly before transitioning
- History display (if accessible) shows only player guesses and feedback
- No persistent solution reference for learning and improvement

## Expected Behavior
- Solution displayed prominently at top or bottom of history screen
- Clear visual distinction from player guesses
- Accessible for educational review and pattern learning

## Proposed Implementation
- Add solution display to history renderer
- Position at top of history with clear labeling ("Solution:" or "The Answer Was:")
- Use same visual styling as game elements for consistency
- Ensure mobile-responsive positioning

## Files to Modify
- `js/managers/HistoryRenderer.js` - Add solution display method
- Potentially `js/scenes/GameScene.js` - If history view is accessible during game

## Success Criteria
- Solution clearly visible in history view
- Visually distinct from player guesses
- Mobile-responsive positioning
- Consistent with existing UI styling

- **Mobile Impact**: Large assets negatively affect mobile device performance

## Expected Improvements
- **Faster Loading**: Optimized assets for quicker browser transfer
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Remove unused assets to minimize download
- **Better Mobile Performance**: Right-sized images for mobile devices
- **Efficient Testing**: Faster localhost loading during development
- **Asset Flexibility**: Clean asset structure for easy element swapping

## Proposed Actions
1. **🍭 Mistletoe → Candy Cane Replacement** ✅ **COMPLETED** (July 15, 2025)
   - ✅ Updated element array in `js/utils/GameUtils.js` ('Mistletoe' → 'Candy Cane')
   - ✅ Updated asset loading in `js/scenes/GameScene.js` (all resolutions: 1x, 2x, 3x)
   - ✅ Updated asset mapping in `js/scenes/RoundOver.js` 
   - ✅ Updated description text in `js/scenes/MainMenu.js` (🪴 Mistletoe → 🍭 Candy Canes)
   - ✅ All syntax validation passed
   - ✅ Game testing successful - all tests pass
2. **🗑️ Unused File Removal** ✅ **COMPLETED** (July 15, 2025) 
   - ✅ Removed 4 mistletoe assets (286KB total): `mistletoe.png`, `mistletoe_1x.png`, `mistletoe_2x.png`, `mistletoe_3x.png`
   - ✅ Removed unused background: `bg_mobile_orig.png` (119KB)
   - ✅ Fixed asset loading case sensitivity issues in `GameScene.js`
   - ✅ Total space saved: ~405KB
3. **✅ Asset Audit Complete** ✅ **COMPLETED** (July 15, 2025)
   - ✅ Final asset inventory: 34 PNG files, 6.0M total size
   - ✅ All assets verified as in use (no unused files remaining)
   - ✅ Asset loading paths corrected for case sensitivity
   - ✅ Largest assets identified for potential future optimization:
     - `feedback_perfect_star.png` (1.1M) - Christmas feedback symbol
     - `feedback_close_bell.png` (736K) - Christmas feedback symbol  
     - `snowflake.png` (731K) - Game element
     - `santa.png` (642K) - Game element
     - `candycane.png` (601K) - Game element (new!)
4. **Size Optimization**: Large feedback/element images could be compressed (optional)
5. **Resolution Analysis**: 1x/2x/3x images are appropriately sized ✅
6. **Loading Strategy**: Asset loading working efficiently ✅

## ✅ **ASSET-001 COMPLETION SUMMARY**
- **🍭 Element Replacement**: Successfully replaced mistletoe with candy canes
- **🗑️ Cleanup**: Removed 5 unused assets, saved ~405KB

**Next Steps**: Asset optimization is complete. The remaining large files are all actively used and functional. Future optimization could focus on compressing the largest feedback/element images, but this is optional as performance is acceptable.

## Investigation Commands
```bash
# Check current asset usage
find assets/ -name "*.png" -exec ls -lh {} \; | sort -k5 -hr
grep -r "assets/" js/ --include="*.js" | sort | uniq
```
