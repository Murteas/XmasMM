## üö® Open Issues

### UI-009: Game Screen History Space Optimization  
**Issue ID**: UI-009  
**Date Created**: July 16, 2025  
**Date Completed**: July 16, 2025  
**Severity**: Medium - Mobile UX improvement  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - ARCHIVED  
**Related Task**: GameScreenHistoryCompression (Completed)

**Problem Description**:
Based on user screenshot testing with 9 guesses, the game history section consumes excessive vertical space (76% of mobile screen), making the interface feel cramped and reducing visibility of current actions.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Row Height Compression**: Reduced from 60px to 40px (33% space savings)
- **Symbol Optimization**: Feedback symbols reduced to 14px with tighter 16px spacing  
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Newest 2 rows stay full opacity, older rows fade to 80%
- **Result**: 9 guesses now use 360px vs 540px (saves 180px vertical space)

**Files Modified**: `js/managers/HistoryRenderer.js`  
**Testing**: ‚úÖ Syntax validation passed, ready for browser testing

### UI-004: History Screen Missing Solution Display
**Issue ID**: UI-004  
**Date Created**: July 15, 2025  
**Severity**: Medium - Usability improvement  
**Status**: üîÑ MERGED into RoundOverScenePolish task  
**Related Task**: RoundOverScenePolish

**Problem Description**: The game history/guess review screen does not display the correct solution for post-game comparison. Players cannot easily compare their guesses against the actual solution when reviewing their game performance.

**Resolution**: This requirement has been merged into the RoundOverScenePolish task for comprehensive RoundOver scene optimization.

### UI-006: Active Guess Row Scroll Accessibility
**Issue ID**: UI-006  
**Date Created**: July 15, 2025  
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Core gameplay blocker  
**Status**: ÔøΩ In Progress - Phase 1 implementation  
**Related Task**: GameScreenMobileOptimization

**Problem Description**:
When users scroll up to view previous guesses, the active guess row (where the player makes their current guess) disappears and becomes inaccessible. This makes it impossible to continue playing without scrolling back down to find the input area.

**Phase 1 Solution: Difficulty Simplification**
- Remove 6-element option (reduces scroll complexity)
- Standardize max guesses to 10 (eliminates edge cases)
- Simplify difficulty labels: "Easy" (4 elements) and "Standard" (5 elements)
- Expected outcome: Scroll issues become rare/eliminated

**Future Enhancement: Footer Experience Improvement**
**Issue ID**: UI-008 (Future)
**Concept**: Enhance footer active row with visual connections and micro-interactions
- Add subtle visual line/arrow connecting last guess to footer input
- Implement smooth animations when new guess is submitted
- Consider pulsing or glow effects to draw attention to active input
- **Benefits**: Improves visual flow without positioning complexity
- **Risk**: Low - no repositioning, just visual enhancements
- **Effort**: ~30 minutes implementation
- **Note**: Deferred pending Phase 1 results

**Implementation Status**:
- ‚úÖ Phase 1 Complete: Difficulty system simplified
  - Removed 6-element option (eliminated edge case complexity)
  - Fixed max guesses at 10 (removed user selection confusion)
  - Updated labels: "Easy" (4 elements) vs "Standard" (5 elements)
  - Updated help text to match new system
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Inline guessing: Deferred pending Phase 1 testing results
- üìã Visual enhancements: Documented for future implementation

**Files Modified**:
- `js/scenes/DifficultySelection.js` - Simplified difficulty selection UI
- `js/scenes/MainMenu.js` - Updated help text to match new system

**Next Steps**:
1. **TESTING REQUIRED**: User should test new difficulty selection on mobile
2. Verify that 10-guess limit reduces/eliminates scroll issues  
3. If successful, consider Phase 2 implementation or mark as resolved

**Additional UI/UX Issues from Screenshot Analysis:**
- The "Santa's Hint" button overlaps the "Hint: Available" label, making the UI cluttered. These should be visually separated.
- The "Christmas Feedback" legend box is large and pushes the guess rows down, reducing visible space for guesses. Consider making it collapsible, smaller, or floating.
- Guess rows and feedback columns are tightly packed; spacing and alignment could be improved for readability.
- The "Back" and "GO" buttons are at opposite corners and may be hard to reach on mobile‚Äîconsider grouping or making them more prominent.
- The scrollable area is not visually distinct from the rest of the UI, which may confuse users about what can be scrolled.
- Feedback symbols (stars, bells) could be larger or have more padding for clarity.

**Expected Behavior**:
- The active guess row should always remain accessible, regardless of scroll position
- Implement native mobile touch scrolling for better UX
- OR ensure active row is sticky/fixed at bottom of screen

**Proposed Implementation Options**:
1. **Native Scrolling**: Replace button-based scrolling with native touch scrolling
2. **Sticky Active Row**: Keep current guess input fixed at bottom of viewport
3. **Jump Button**: Add floating action button to quickly return to active row

**Files to Modify**:
- `js/scenes/GameScene.js` - Scroll implementation and active row positioning
- `js/managers/ActiveRowManager.js` - Active row state management

### UI-007: Santa's Hint Intermittent Failure
**Issue ID**: UI-007  
**Date Created**: July 16, 2025  
**Date Resolved**: July 16, 2025  
**Severity**: Medium - Feature reliability  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Hint system completely rewritten  
**Related Task**: Hint system improvements (Completed)

**Problem Description**:
Santa's Hint button worked inconsistently - sometimes provided hints correctly, other times did nothing with no console errors.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Complete hint system rewrite with strategic selection logic
- Always-available hints with clear penalty display (-200 pts)
- Persistent hint display with manual dismiss
- Visual glow highlighting in footer container
- Reliable hint button functionality verified

**Files Modified**: GameInputHandler.js, ScoreManager.js
- Separate the hint button and label for clarity.
- Make the feedback legend collapsible, smaller, or floating.
- Improve spacing and alignment of guess rows and feedback columns.
- Group or reposition "Back" and "GO" buttons for easier access.
- Visually distinguish the scrollable area.
- Increase size/padding of feedback symbols for clarity.

**Files to Modify**:
- `js/scenes/GameScene.js` - Guess row rendering, scroll/active row logic, hint button handler, layout
- `js/managers/ActiveRowManager.js` - Active row positioning and state
- `js/managers/HintManager.js` or related logic - Hint functionality

**Success Criteria**:
- Active guess row is always accessible, regardless of scroll position
- Santa's Hint button provides a hint and user feedback
- UI is visually clear, well-spaced, and mobile-optimized
- No regression in mobile usability or layout

**Problem Description**: The game history/guess review screen does not display the correct solution for post-game comparison. Players cannot easily compare their guesses against the actual solution when reviewing their game performance.

**Current Behavior**:
- RoundOver scene shows the solution briefly before transitioning
- History display (if accessible) shows only player guesses and feedback
- No persistent solution reference for learning and improvement

**Expected Behavior**:
- Solution displayed prominently at top or bottom of history screen
- Clear visual distinction from player guesses
- Accessible for educational review and pattern learning

**Proposed Implementation**:
- Add solution display to history renderer
- Position at top of history with clear labeling ("Solution:" or "The Answer Was:")
- Use same visual styling as game elements for consistency
- Ensure mobile-responsive positioning

**Files to Modify**:
- `js/managers/HistoryRenderer.js` - Add solution display method
- Potentially `js/scenes/GameScene.js` - If history view is accessible during game

**Success Criteria**:
- Solution clearly visible in history view
- Visually distinct from player guesses
- Mobile-responsive positioning
- Consistent with existing UI styling
