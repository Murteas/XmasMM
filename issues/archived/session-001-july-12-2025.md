## 📋 Resolved Issues from this Session

### **TMS-001: Task Management System Sync Issue** ✅ RESOLVED

**Issue ID**: TMS-001  
**Date Reported**: July 12, 2025  
**Date Resolved**: July 12, 2025  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Status**: ✅ Closed  

## Problem Description
The task management automation system had a synchronization issue where completing a task via `python scripts/automation.py complete <task>` did not properly update the task status in real-time queries.

## Root Cause Found
The issue was that after completing QualityIndicators, the system correctly marked it as COMPLETED but failed to automatically start the next ready task (MobileLayoutOptimization). This left the system in a state with no CURRENT task.

## Resolution
**Manual Fix Applied:**
```python
python -c "from scripts.task_manager import TaskManager; tm = TaskManager(); tm.start_task('MobileLayoutOptimization')"
```

**Verification:**
- ✅ `automation.py status` now shows MobileLayoutOptimization as CURRENT
- ✅ No validation issues reported
- ✅ Task progression working correctly

## Prevention
- **Immediate**: Task sync issue resolved for current workflow
- **Future**: Consider adding auto-start functionality to `complete_task()` method
